## Covid Data Dashboard

with the help of Alex Freberg's great tutorial I did following steps and added my own improvements in terms of dataset comparison and interpretation options:<br>

1.) I downoladed the data from ourworldindata.org <br>
2.) I used <b>MS Excel</b> to format and inspect the dataset <br>
3.) I learned how to use <b>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</b> to import the Excel Data <br>
       --> I have solved the problems with data type reconfiguration <br>
4.) I got better at <b>SQL</b> and used some queries to explore new and older versions of dataset <br>
5.) I used SQL queries to prepare some data for Tableau visualisation <br>
6.) I created my first <b>Tableau</b> dashboard including the comparation of two datasets (older and new) <br>
<b>7.) I have found other ways of interpreting the data, especially with regard to the evolution of the virus and its danger</b>
