Snippets and info related to my portfolio projects

##1.) UFC STATS ANALYSIS – INTRO
27 years of UFC fights in stats. I focused od the data interpretations.
1.) I downloaded the data from kaggle.com
2.) I used <b>MS Excel</b> to format and inspect the dataset <br>
3.) I used <b> pandas </b> to make exploratory analysis and test the validity of the dataset
4.) I wrote a script to test the dataset further (e. g. generating particular fighter stats when prompted)
5.) I estabilished areas of my research --> refs statistics / evolution of sport in general etc. 

### UFC STATS ANALYSIS – A Closer Look at the Referees
1.) I wrote a script corresponding with my questions of research:
             a.) Who are the busiest referees in the UFC?
             b.) What are the stats of a particular referee?
             c.) How do the statistics of the types of finishes for the 10 busiest UFC referees look like?
2.) I designed some visualisation preview using <b>pandas</b> and <b>matplotlib</b> (further could be done in Excel or Tableau)
3.) I interpreted my data


## Covid Data Dashboard

with the help of Alex Freberg's great tutorial I did following steps and added my own improvements in terms of dataset comparison and interpretation options:<br>

1.) I downoladed the data from ourworldindata.org <br>
2.) I used <b>MS Excel</b> to format and inspect the dataset <br>
3.) I learned how to use <b>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</b> to import the Excel Data <br>
       --> I have solved the problems with data type reconfiguration <br>
4.) I got better at <b>SQL</b> and used some queries to explore new and older versions of dataset <br>
5.) I used SQL queries to prepare some data for Tableau visualisation <br>
6.) I created my first <b>Tableau</b> dashboard including the comparation of two datasets (older and new) <br>
<b>7.) I have found other ways of interpreting the data, especially with regard to the evolution of the virus and its danger</b>
