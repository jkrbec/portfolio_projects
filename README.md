## 1.) UFC STATS ANALYSIS – INTRO
27 years of UFC fights in stats. I focused od the data interpretations.<br>
1.) I downloaded the data from kaggle.com<br>
2.) I used <b>MS Excel</b> to format and inspect the dataset <br>
3.) I used <b> pandas </b> to make exploratory analysis and test the validity of the dataset<br>
4.) I wrote a script to test the dataset further (e. g. generating particular fighter stats when prompted)<br>
5.) I estabilished areas of my research --> refs statistics / evolution of sport in general etc. <br>
6.) I tested <b>DataSpell</b> of <b>JetBrains</b> for a very first time<br>

### UFC STATS ANALYSIS – A Closer Look at the Referees (+ Streamlit App)
1.) I wrote a script corresponding with my questions of research:<br>
             a.) Who are the busiest referees in the UFC?<br>
             b.) What are the stats of a particular referee?<br>
             c.) How do the statistics of the types of finishes for the 10 busiest UFC referees look like?<br>
2.) I designed some visualisation preview using <b>pandas</b> and <b>matplotlib</b> (further could be done in Excel or Tableau)<br>
3.) I interpreted my data<br>

### Streamlit App
1.) Import necessary libraries (e.g. pandas, plotly, streamlit)<br>
2.) Load the data into a pandas DataFrame<br>
3.) Set up the Streamlit app by defining the page configuration and creating a sidebar for user input<br>
4.) Filter the data based on the user's selections in the sidebar<br>
5.) Loop through the unique values in the 'ref' column, grouping the data by 'win_by' and calculating the percentage of fights with each 'win_by' value for each referee<br>
6.) Create a new DataFrame with the results of the loop<br>
7.) Display the results table and bar chart using Streamlit's built-in functions<br>
8.) (Optional) Use plotly's customization options to improve the appearance and readability of the chart.<br>

## Covid Data Dashboard

with the help of Alex Freberg's great tutorial I did following steps and added my own improvements in terms of dataset comparison and interpretation options:<br>

1.) I downoladed the data from ourworldindata.org <br>
2.) I used <b>MS Excel</b> to format and inspect the dataset <br>
3.) I learned how to use <b>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</b> to import the Excel Data <br>
       --> I have solved the problems with data type reconfiguration <br>
4.) I got better at <b>SQL</b> and used some queries to explore new and older versions of dataset <br>
5.) I used SQL queries to prepare some data for Tableau visualisation <br>
6.) I created my first <b>Tableau</b> dashboard including the comparation of two datasets (older and new) <br>
<b>7.) I have found other ways of interpreting the data, especially with regard to the evolution of the virus and its danger</b>
