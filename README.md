### Check out my Covid Data Dashboard in Tableau:
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jara.k/viz/covid_dashboard_16707444180020/Dashboard1
with the help of Alex Freberg's great tutorial I did following steps and added my own improvements in terms of dataset comparison and interpretation options:

1.) I downoladed the data from ourworldindata.org
2.) I used MS Excel to format and inspect the dataset
3.) I learned how to use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to import the Excel Data
       --> I have solved the problems with data type reconfiguration
4.) I got better at SQL and used some queries to explore new and older versions of dataset
5.) I used SQL queries to prepare some data for Tableau visualisation
6.) I created my first Tableau dashboard including the comparation of two datasets (older and new)
7.) I have found other ways of interpreting the data, especially with regard to the evolution of the virus and its danger
